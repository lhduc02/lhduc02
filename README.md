 ### About me :
 
 As a former student of Hanoi University of Science and Technology, majoring in AI and Big Data, and currently a Data Analyst/Data Engineer, I aspire to create value for society through data.
 
 I have hands-on experience as a Data Engineer Intern at PPCLINK Mobile, where I worked on user behavior analytics projects. I designed ETL processes for an application with 4 million Monthly Active Users and 400 million events per month, utilizing Python (Pandas, PySpark), MySQL, and ClickHouse.
 
 Currently, I am working full-time at Amobear Game Studio, taking on dual roles as both a Data Analyst and a Data Engineer. As a Data Analyst, I evaluate marketing strategies, conduct customer segmentation, and optimize IAP packages to enhance user experience. At the same time, as a Data Engineer, I contributed to the development of the company's Data Platform and now take full responsibility for its operation and maintenance, ensuring its stability and efficiency.
 
 I have a strong passion for applied machine learning, large-scale data storage and processing technologies (such as Kafka, Spark, Flink, Airflow, etc.). Additionally, I am conducting in-depth research on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLM).
 
 In my free time, I enjoy watching football, reading books, and playing chess.
