 ### About me :
 
I am a Data Engineer at Joybit Game Studio, where I design and maintain scalable ELT pipelines on Google Cloud Platform using BigQuery, Airflow, and dbt. My work focuses on building reliable, production-grade data systems that power analytics and support business decision-making.

Previously at Amobear Technology Group, I contributed to the development of a data platform processing over one billion records per month. I worked across both data engineering and analytics functions, collaborating with product and marketing teams to improve user segmentation, optimize IAP strategies, and enhance key business metrics through data-driven insights.

I am particularly interested in data warehouse architecture, pipeline optimization, and production reliability. My goal is to continuously deepen my understanding of scalable data systems and system design principles, while also exploring applied machine learning from a production and infrastructure perspective.

Always open to conversations about data architecture, warehouse optimization, and production reliability.
